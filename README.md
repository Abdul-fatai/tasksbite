## Contribution guideline
<h6>  Create an issue<h6>
<p>   Nobody's perfect. Something doesn't work? Or could be done better? Let us know by creating an issue.</p>
<p>   PS: a clear and detailed issue gets lots of love, all you have to do is follow the issue template!</p>
<h5>  Create a pull request</h5>
<p>  Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.</p>
<p>  Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit.</p>
<p>  Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.</p>
<p>  If there's an existing issue related to the pull request, reference to it by adding something like References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #305, where 305 is the issue number. </p>
<p>  If you follow the pull request template, you can't go wrong.</p>

<i> Please note: all commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged, but when your PR is approved and passes our CI, it will be live on production!</i>
